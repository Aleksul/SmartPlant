# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Gitlab
We use gitlab to host code, 3d models and hardware design, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept merge requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Merge Requests
Merge requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your merge requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add your code or hardware design improvements.
5. Make sure your code lints and your hardware design passes Electrical Rules Check (ERC).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitLab's [issues](https://gitlab.com/aleksul/smart-plant/-/issues)
We use GitLab issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://gitlab.com/aleksul/smart-plant/-/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
